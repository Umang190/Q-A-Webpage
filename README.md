# ðŸ§  Web-Based Question Answering System (Flask + LangChain + FAISS)

This is a simple question-answering project I made using Python and Flask. It can fetch text from a webpage, convert it into chunks, create embeddings using Hugging Face models, and store them using FAISS. Then it lets you ask questions from that webpage content and get answers based on it.
